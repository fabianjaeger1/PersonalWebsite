[{"content":"Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease which leads to the gradual loss of neuronal cells. Several hypotheses for AD exists (e.g., cholinergic, amyloid, tau hypotheses, etc.). As per the cholinergic hypothesis, the deficiency of choline is responsible for AD; therefore, the inhibition of AChE is a lucrative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine that is essential for cognition and memory. A large non-redundant data set of 2,570 compounds with reported IC50 values against AChE was obtained from ChEMBL and employed in quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study so as to gain insights on their origin of bioactivity. AChE inhibitors were described by a set of 12 fingerprint descriptors and predictive models were constructed from 100 different data splits using random forest. Generated models afforded R2, Q2CV and Q2Ext values in ranges of 0.66–0.93, 0.55–0.79 and 0.56–0.81 for the training set, 10-fold cross-validated set and external set, respectively. The best model built using the substructure count was selected according to the OECD guidelines and it afforded R2, Q2CV and Q2Ext values of 0.92 ± 0.01, 0.78 ± 0.06 and 0.78 ± 0.05, respectively. Furthermore, Y-scrambling was applied to evaluate the possibility of chance correlation of the predictive model. Subsequently, a thorough analysis of the substructure fingerprint count was conducted to provide informative insights on the inhibitory activity of AChE inhibitors. Moreover, Kennard–Stone sampling of the actives were applied to select 30 diverse compounds for further molecular docking studies in order to gain structural insights on the origin of AChE inhibition. Site-moiety mapping of compounds from the diversity set revealed three binding anchors encompassing both hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interaction. Molecular docking revealed that compounds 13, 5 and 28 exhibited the lowest binding energies of −12.2, −12.0 and −12.0 kcal/mol, respectively, against human AChE, which is modulated by hydrogen bonding, π–π stacking and hydrophobic interaction inside the binding pocket. These information may be used as guidelines for the design of novel and robust AChE inhibitors.\nFull-text article Read article\n","permalink":"https://fabianjaeger1.github.io/PersonalWebsite/projects/acetylcholinesterase/","summary":"Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease which leads to the gradual loss of neuronal cells.

I graduated in 2023 from ETH Zurich. I conducted my research in the Materials Theory Group under Prof. Nicola Spaldin. I joined initially in Fall 2022 to work on the behaviour of polar metals, an unusual and even contraindicated combination that leads to some exotic physics.\nThere as a Student Researcher, I performed electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory and constructed physical Hamiltonian models to demonstrate that two phenomena, the kinetic magnetoelectric effect and the non-linear Hall effect, are universal to polar metals. This work will be published in Physical Review Research with Sayantika Bhowal in APS and the pre-print can be found here.\nDuring my studies, I took on a a few machine learning modules and got facinated by the field and so I decided to get a student jobs working in Data Science for a small pharma company that aims to deliver a drug-identificaton software to pharmacies.\nFor my Master Thesis I then continued applying AI and worked on training state-of-the art universal machine learning force fields (UFF\u0026rsquo;s) using MACE and M3GNet for two-dimensional material using a curated dataset of roughly 88'000 structures and exploring it as an alternative method to using Cluster Expansion for alloy modelling.\nMy Bachelor Thesis was conducted in the group of Prof. Titus Neupert and dealt with investigating the phases of floquet-driven quantum many-body critical systems in one and two-dimensions. This included a numerical simulation part as well as the analysis of an analytical solution using conformal field theory. The plots on this one I think are kinda neat!\nAdditional I will also leave some of my write-ups here, in case anyone can find use in them:\nQuantenmechanik I: This is a 200 page \u0026lsquo;summary\u0026rsquo; of the content covered in the quantum mechanics I course from the Fall Semester 2019.
