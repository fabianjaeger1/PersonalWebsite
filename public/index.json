[{"content":"Abstract Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease which leads to the gradual loss of neuronal cells. Several hypotheses for AD exists (e.g., cholinergic, amyloid, tau hypotheses, etc.). As per the cholinergic hypothesis, the deficiency of choline is responsible for AD; therefore, the inhibition of AChE is a lucrative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine that is essential for cognition and memory. A large non-redundant data set of 2,570 compounds with reported IC50 values against AChE was obtained from ChEMBL and employed in quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study so as to gain insights on their origin of bioactivity. AChE inhibitors were described by a set of 12 fingerprint descriptors and predictive models were constructed from 100 different data splits using random forest. Generated models afforded R2, Q2CV and Q2Ext values in ranges of 0.66‚Äì0.93, 0.55‚Äì0.79 and 0.56‚Äì0.81 for the training set, 10-fold cross-validated set and external set, respectively. The best model built using the substructure count was selected according to the OECD guidelines and it afforded R2, Q2CV and Q2Ext values of 0.92 ¬± 0.01, 0.78 ¬± 0.06 and 0.78 ¬± 0.05, respectively. Furthermore, Y-scrambling was applied to evaluate the possibility of chance correlation of the predictive model. Subsequently, a thorough analysis of the substructure fingerprint count was conducted to provide informative insights on the inhibitory activity of AChE inhibitors. Moreover, Kennard‚ÄìStone sampling of the actives were applied to select 30 diverse compounds for further molecular docking studies in order to gain structural insights on the origin of AChE inhibition. Site-moiety mapping of compounds from the diversity set revealed three binding anchors encompassing both hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interaction. Molecular docking revealed that compounds 13, 5 and 28 exhibited the lowest binding energies of ‚àí12.2, ‚àí12.0 and ‚àí12.0 kcal/mol, respectively, against human AChE, which is modulated by hydrogen bonding, œÄ‚ÄìœÄ stacking and hydrophobic interaction inside the binding pocket. These information may be used as guidelines for the design of novel and robust AChE inhibitors.\nFull-text article Read article\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/PersonalWebsite/projects/acetylcholinesterase/","summary":"Abstract Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease which leads to the gradual loss of neuronal cells.

To be honest with you, I didn‚Äôt know what to expect going into this. Foreverliketh.is‚Äîwho was the host for the month of January‚Äîemailed me one day asking me if I wanted to host one of the upcoming months because the carnival was running short on hosts and I obviously accepted.\nHis month on the topic of Positive Internalization saw 13 people contributing and so I said to myself ‚ÄúIf 10 to 15 people decide to participate in February I‚Äôll consider that a win‚Äù.\nWell, looks like we got there. I have 44 links in front of me so this is going to be quite the roundup but before we jump into that let me first say thank you to all the people who decided to take the time to participate. You‚Äôre all a bunch of awesome people. Also, the Carnival continues and this month‚Äôs topic is going to be Accessibility in the Small Web. Look forward to reading your posts there. Now it‚Äôs time to dive into the submissions.\nWhat am I going to do about it? This is a test of what I think the bottom section should look like\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/PersonalWebsite/thoughts/","summary":"thoughts","title":"Thoughts"}]
