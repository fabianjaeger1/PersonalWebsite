      <description>This was a challenge proposed by SIX Financial Informations at the START Hack 2024 in St.Gallen.
What is ESG? Description As the wordplay might suggest, it is a gamified pixel-art eco-system visualisation of your ESG score for your portfolio. This allows investors to quickly grasp the system&amp;rsquo;s health through distinctive icons and tilesets that represent the four key areas: Growth, Environmental, Social, and Governance factors of the portfolio.
At the core, each fund is represented by a tree.</description>

      <description>A small daily game, (Fermle), created over a weekend and inspired by popular sites like Wordle and Travle. Each day, a new Fermi question is presented, and players have three attempts to guess the correct answer. The score is based on the number of tries and the accuracy of the guesses.
The goal of this project was to learn the basics of website deployment. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</description>
