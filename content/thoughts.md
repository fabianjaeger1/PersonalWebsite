<!-- ## Let's hope

February has come to an end and with it also ended my experience hosting the 9th edition of the IndieWeb Carnival. To be honest with you, I didn’t know what to expect going into this. Foreverliketh.is—who was the host for the month of January—emailed me one day asking me if I wanted to host one of the upcoming months because the carnival was running short on hosts and I obviously accepted.

His month on the topic of Positive Internalization saw 13 people contributing and so I said to myself “If 10 to 15 people decide to participate in February I’ll consider that a win”.

Well, looks like we got there. I have 44 links in front of me so this is going to be quite the roundup but before we jump into that let me first say thank you to all the people who decided to take the time to participate. You’re all a bunch of awesome people. Also, the Carnival continues and this month’s topic is going to be Accessibility in the Small Web. Look forward to reading your posts there. Now it’s time to dive into the submissions.


### What am I going to do about it?

This is a test of what I think the bottom section should look like
