In my daytime, I work as a Developer Advocate at a US Tech company. 

At night, I'm a content creator developing tutorials in data science for the following platforms:
- 📺 **YouTube**: [**Data Professor**](https://youtube.com/dataprofessor/), [**Coding Professor**](https://youtube.com/codingprofessor/)
- 📝 [**Medium Blogs**](https://data-professor.medium.com/).
- 💻 [**GitHub**](https://github.com/dataprofessor/)

In my previous role, I was an Associate Professor of Bioinformatics carrying out research in computational drug discovery:

### Welcome

Hi, I’m **Fabian Jaeger**. I document my learnings on **Artificial Intelligence**, **Science**, and **Software Development** in my blog. My interests include interpretable and reliable AI systems, Graph Machine Learning, and the intersection of Machine Learning with the sciences. If this intrigues you, feel free to explore my blog, where I share various insights and findings. (Please note, it’s still under construction.)


### Background

My background is in **theoretical condensed matter and quantum physics**. I graduated in 2023 from **[ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html)**. I conducted my research in the [Materials Theory Group](https://theory.mat.ethz.ch/) under Prof. [Nicola Spaldin](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=eUfdZowAAAAJ&hl=en). I joined initially in Fall 2022 to work on the behaviour of polar metals, an unusual and even contraindicated combination that leads to some exotic physics. 

There as a student researcher, I performed electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory and constructed physical Hamiltonian models to demonstrate that two phenomena, the kinetic magnetoelectric effect and the non-linear Hall effect, are universal to polar metals. This work was published in Physical Review Research with [Sayantika Bhowal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KEbHeN0AAAAJ&hl=en) in [APS](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.6.013251) and the pre-print can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.09794.pdf).

During my studies, I took on a few machine learning modules and got facinated by the field and so I decided to get a part-time job working in Data Science for a small pharma company that aims to deliver a drug-identificaton software to pharmacies. 

For my **[Master Thesis](Master_Thesis.pdf)** I then continued applying AI and worked on training state-of-the art universal machine learning force fields (UFF's) using [MACE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07697.pdf) and [M3GNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.02450.pdf) for two-dimensional material using a curated dataset of roughly 88'000 structures and exploring it as an alternative method to using Cluster Expansion for alloy modelling. Some of the results are published in the paper ["Improving machine-learning models in materials science through large datasets"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542529324002360).


My **[Bachelor Thesis](Bachelor_Thesis.pdf)** was conducted in the group of [Prof. Titus Neupert](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zXNka-AAAAAJ&hl=en) and dealt with investigating the phases of floquet-driven quantum many-body critical systems in one and two-dimensions. This included a numerical simulation part as well as the analysis of an analytical solution using conformal field theory. The plots on this one I think are kinda neat!


### Other Stuff

I will also leave some of my write-ups here, in case anyone can find use in them:
- [Quantenmechanik I](Quantenmechanik.pdf): This is a 200 page 'summary' in German of the content covered in the quantum mechanics I course from the Fall Semester 2019.
- [Short Survey on Bayesian Neural Networks](Survey_BNN.pdf): This is a short overview and heavily inspired by Wilson et. al *"Bayesian Deep Learning and a Probabilistic Perspective of Generalization"*
